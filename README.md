Scripts
=======
This repo has all general scripts I will want to use in various analyses.  
These are not one-off scripts - but are for analyses that need to be run commonly, on a common set of files - i.e. map RNAseq data -> count -> DE 
They should not be directly invoked from here, but instead move them to the working directory and make any changes needed.  

If a particularly useful set of changes, or the overal approach is changed, the script should be pushed back to this repo.
